### ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

I'm Deniz, a student developing useful programs & apps for Desktop, Mobile and Wearables as a hobby. I like to develop features or even entire applications for things that i find lacking, while extending beyond what is normally possible.

#### Programming languages & UI Frameworks i use
- C# (Winforms, WinUI 3)
- Kotlin (Jetpack Compose)
- JavaScript (HTML & CSS)
- C++ (ESP & Arduino)
- Python
